In this case, the Builder class is made as a subclass to the entity (Cat.class) file

So, while accessing the builder from the main method, we would be using
new outerClass.innerClass().setAttribute - that is, new Cat.CatBuilder().set...............

One more change is..
The constructor takes in the Builder as argument instead of the individual attributes
And, each attribute is set using the builder
Please refer the constructor in this and compare it against the constructor in example3.
